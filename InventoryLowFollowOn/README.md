# InventoryLowFollowOn

This is a very simple Lambda function that doesn't do much other than print out its event and say hello.  

Its primary purpose is to serve as a demonstration that a Lambda function (this one) can successfully be used as a subscriber to an SNS topic.  
See explanation in InventoryNotifyOnLowQuantity.
